# FinTech and Urban Economic Growth

This project examines the nonlinear relationship between fintech development and urban economic growth in South Korea.

Using panel data from 17 Korean cities over the period 2014–2023, this study investigates whether fintech development uniformly promotes economic growth or exhibits stage-dependent effects.

## Research Question

Does fintech development always promote urban economic growth, or do early-stage adjustment costs offset its benefits?

---

## Data and Methodology

- **Data**: Panel data of 17 Korean cities (2014–2023)
- **Key FinTech Measure**: City-level fintech-related patent applications
- **Outcome Variable**: Per capita GRDP
- **Method**: Fixed-effects panel regression with nonlinear (quadratic) specification
- **Robustness Checks**:
  - Lag and lead specifications
  - Exclusion of Seoul
  - Exclusion of COVID-19 period

---

## Main Findings

- The relationship between fintech development and urban economic growth follows a **U-shaped pattern**.
- In the early stage, fintech development negatively affects per capita GRDP due to adjustment costs.
- Once fintech development exceeds a critical threshold (approximately 24 patent applications, ln ≈ 3.18), its impact becomes significantly positive.
- The marginal effect reaches up to 0.278 at higher levels of fintech development.

## Heterogeneity Analysis

The positive effects of fintech development are stronger in:
- Capital-region cities
- Service-oriented economies
- Cities with higher initial fintech levels
- Regions with a larger presence of large firms
